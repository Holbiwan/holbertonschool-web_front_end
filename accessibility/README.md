# Project Accessibility ðŸ“Œ

Accessibility in web design ensures websites are usable by people with disabilities. ARIA markup enhances accessibility for dynamic content. WCAG sets standards, with levels A, AA, and AAA. Accessibility is vital for inclusivity, user experience, and social responsibility. Tools like accessibility checkers and screen readers aid in achieving accessibility goals.

Web accessibility is crucial because it ensures that all users, regardless of their abilities, can access and interact with web content effectively. By prioritizing accessibility, websites can reach a broader audience, enhance user experience, and demonstrate social responsibility and inclusivity.

To facilitate web accessibility, there are various tools available to developers and designers. These include accessibility checkers, which analyze web content for compliance with accessibility standards, screen readers for testing content accessibility for visually impaired users, and browser extensions that simulate various disabilities to help identify accessibility issues during development. These tools play a vital role in creating a more inclusive web environment for all users.
